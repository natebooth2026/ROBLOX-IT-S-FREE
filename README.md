# ROBLOX: IT'S FREE
To run the executable:
1. Download the Executable & Dependencies Directory
2. Run the .exe file :)
   
To run my code:
1. The VS2022 project needs to be setup to support the following includes:
	`#include <GL/glut.h>
	#include <GL/freeglut.h>
	#include <windows.h>
	#include <mmsystem.h>
	#include <iostream>
	#include <stdio.h>
	#include <cstdlib>
	#include <vector>
	#include <irrKlang/irrKlang.h>
	using namespace irrklang;`
2. In the project folder where main.cpp will be housed, place the audio folder into that directory
3. Go into the provided IRRKLANG folder and take and place irrKlang.lib file into the ./lib directory (make sure to include irrklang.lib as an Additional Dependency in Project Properties-->Linker-->General)
4. In the same IRRKLANG folder, take the IrrKlang folder and place into the ./include directory
5. In the same IRRKLANG folder, take the irrKlang.dll and ikpMP3.dll files and place into the same directory you placed main.cpp
6. Run the code :)
